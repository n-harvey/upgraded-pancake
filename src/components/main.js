                                Welcome to the Deagle Boiz! We are a group of friends with over 15 years of experience in gaming. We've been playing together
                                for a long time and have a lot of fun doing it.
                                <br />
                                Our goal with this website is to keep track of the games and servers we're currently playing on. On our website, you'll find
                                information about the games we're currently playing, as well as information about the servers we're using.
                                <br />
                                You'll also find information about the members of our group, so you can get to know us better. We hope you enjoy the website and
                                we look forward to gaming with you!
